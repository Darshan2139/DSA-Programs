# C++ DSA Practical Programs

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs based on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.  
All practicals are implemented by **Darshan Kachhiya** as part of academic coursework and personal learning.

The following Data Structures and Algorithms are included in this practical collection:

### 🔗 Linear Data Structures
- Array Operations
- Stack (Array & Linked List)
- Queue (Array & Linked List)
- Circular Queue
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

### 🌳 Non-Linear Data Structures
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heap
- Graph (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS & DFS)

### 🔁 Searching & Sorting Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### 🧠 Advanced Algorithms
- Recursion
- Backtracking (e.g., N-Queens)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack)
- Greedy Algorithms (e.g., Activity Selection)
